# Project Overview

This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I came in.



## Get Started

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Run the index.html on your browser of choice.
